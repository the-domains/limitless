  In a quest to fabricate inner-permission to cut-n-run, we end up doing all
  sorts of things to subconsciously sabotage the current career, practice or
  business, life and relationships that, more lovingly and deliberately tended,

  might actually become quite sustainable, if not outright pleasant.
